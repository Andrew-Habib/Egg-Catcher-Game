"# Egg-Catcher-Game" 

This is a grade 11 culminating project that applied concepts ranging from all basic syntax of python, string / list manipulation, functions, classes and other object-oriented programming concepts

The game consists of a user controlling a basket with the mouse or keyboard and moving it across the interface to try and catch falling eggs from 4 chickens. Every 10 eggs, the user passes one level. The subsequent levels have falling eggs that increase in speed as they fall. The game ends when either the user has lost all of his health through broken eggs or the user has passed all of the levels. The user also gets a score at the end.
